I have been upskilling myself with Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision in image processing algorithms, image classification, object detection, tracking system, image segmentation and face recognition among many others and interested to delve more into software engineering. Previously working on ML models using DL4J libraries and labs.
